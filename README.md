# Code for Figures from "Integrating Transcriptomics and Real-World Data" Paper

This repository contains the code used to generate the figures presented in the paper *"The usage of transcriptomics datasets as sources of Real-World Data for clinical trialling"*. The paper describes the development of a patient repository that combines high-throughput transcriptomics data with clinical and demographic Real-World Data (RWD). This repository includes the **scripts and datasets necessary for reproducing the figures**.

## Contents

- R scripts for **figure generation** (`figures/`)
- Datasets used in the paper (`data/`)
