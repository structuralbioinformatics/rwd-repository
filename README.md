This repository contains the code used to generate the figures presented in the paper *"The usage of transcriptomics datasets as sources of Real-World Data for clinical trialling"*. The paper describes the development of a patient repository that combines high-throughput transcriptomics data with clinical and demographic Real-World Data (RWD). This repository includes the **scripts necessary for reproducing the figures**.

## Contents

- R scripts for **figure generation** (`figures/`)

## Data
Due to data filesize limits imposed by GitHub, datasets are available in a separate repository. The files have been uploaded to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13930499).

## Requirements

- **R (>= 3.6)**
- Required R packages: (see `R_packages.txt`)
